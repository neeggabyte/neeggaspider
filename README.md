## A cute bot with an awful name

### TLDR
Everyday in our university (UniTO) telegram groups are born, die and live. 
With every group, comes a unique link that we have to store on our [Simplenote](http://simp.ly/p/MRlJ5H).

Note that this process is not automated at all, we have to collect the link, keep track
and replace them with new links if they break. This is no fun.

Hence, we are developing a bot to keep track and update links for us, so we don't have to do that.
If you are a member of our university, you're kindly welcome to make an issue or a PR for us during
the early developement of this bot. Thanks!
